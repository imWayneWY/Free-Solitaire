ONLINE DEMO: http://123.56.226.100:90/#/


An one day project

I believe most of the functions have been finished. I remember the cards in the foundation field can not been moved anymore, so I design it this way but not like this online demo: https://cardgames.io/freecell/

Because of the time limitation, I didn't consider about the memory control or optimization, so the performance is not great. Also the code is not great for reading. I was focusing on implement the function. The style and layout need a lot of polish work to do, like when I select a pile of cards, it doesn't display the pile but the top card of the pile with some images of other cards. I will try to make it looks better if I had time in the future. This is the best I can do for a one day work.

This project is interesting, I got a lot of fun in it.
